## Core Methodology

Product videos have three components:

1. **Visual Sequence** — How the product is revealed
2. **Animation Style** — Type of motion and transitions
3. **Pacing and Duration** — Timing and rhythm

## Video Types

### Type 1: Product Reveal
**Duration**: 5-15 seconds

**Concept**:
```
Product hidden, then revealed through animation
- Start: Product hidden or obscured

- End: Product fully visible, static shot
```

**Example Prompt**:
```
Product reveal animation: [Product] starts hidden in darkness, 
then smoothly fades in with lighting effects, rotating 360 degrees, 
ending in professional product photography lighting, 
smooth transitions, professional quality, 4K
```

### Type 2: Feature Showcase
**Duration**: 15-30 seconds

**Concept**:
```

```

### Type 5: 360 Spin
**Duration**: 5-10 seconds

**Concept**:
```

## Integration with Other Skills

Product Video works with:
- **Creative Strategist** — Your style guide informs video aesthetic
- **Image Generation** — Generate key frames for video
- **Product Photography** — Product shots become video frames
- **Social Graphics** — Video stills become social assets

## Pro Tips

**Key Frames**: Generate key frames with Image Generation skill  
**Consistency**: Use same lighting and style as product photography  
**Pacing**: Match pacing to your brand personality  
**Music**: Consider music/sound design for full video  
**Platform**: Optimize for platform (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube)  
**Call-to-Action**: Include CTA at end of video  
**Testing**: Test different animation styles and pacing

## Common Pitfalls

**Jerky Animation** — Specify "smooth," "fluid," "professional animation"  
**Inconsistent Style** — Reference your Creative Strategist guide  
**Too Long** — Keep videos short for social media (5-15 seconds)  
**Unclear Message** — Make product benefit clear  
**Poor Lighting** — Lighting must be consistent throughout  
**Distracting Effects** — Effects should enhance, not distract
