## Common Pitfalls

**Poor Lighting** — Lighting is crucial. Be specific about lighting style.  
**Inconsistent Style** — Products don't look like they're from same brand.  
**Cluttered Background** — Background competes with product.  
**Wrong Composition** — Product positioning doesn't draw eye.  
**Low Quality** — Use high image size and quality descriptors.  
**Missing Context** — Lifestyle shots need clear setting and mood.

## Troubleshooting

### Product Looks Cheap
- Add "premium," "luxury," "high-end" to prompt
- Use dramatic lighting instead of flat lighting
- Add quality descriptors: "professional," "award-winning"

### Background Distracts from Product
- Use white or gradient background instead
- Add "minimal background," "focus on product"
- Increase negative space

### Lighting Looks Unnatural
- Specify exact lighting type: "studio," "natural," "golden hour"
- Add "professional lighting," "cinematic"
- Use "soft," "diffused," "even illumination"

### Product Doesn't Match Brand Colors
- Add specific color names to prompt
- Reference your Creative Strategist color palette
- Use color hex codes if possible
