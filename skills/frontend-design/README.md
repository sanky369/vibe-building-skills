# Frontend Design Skills - Complete System

A comprehensive system of **13 interconnected Claude Skills** for building world-class digital experiences. Based on the philosophy of Interface Craft and research from industry experts.

## The 13 Skills

### Foundation Layer (2 skills)

**frontend-orchestrator** — Master coordinator that diagnoses your design maturity and sequences all skills optimally. Start here to get a personalized roadmap.

**design-foundation** — Establish design tokens, system structure, and foundational principles. The base upon which all other skills build.

### Visual Layer (4 skills)

**layout-system** — Create responsive layouts using Flexbox, Grid, and Container Queries. Mobile-first, accessible, and performant.

**typography-system** — Define type scales, hierarchy, and readability. Establish modular typography that scales across devices.

**color-system** — Build color systems with accessibility in mind. Create tinted greys, semantic colors, and accessible contrast.

**visual-hierarchy-refactoring** — Master visual hierarchy through size, weight, contrast, and whitespace. Learn Gestalt principles for organizing information.

### Component Layer (1 skill)

**component-architecture** — Design reusable components using atomic design principles. Build scalable, well-documented component libraries.

### Interaction Layer (4 skills)

**interaction-physics** — Create natural, intentional interactions using momentum, gestures, and animation principles. Make interfaces feel responsive.

**loading-states** — Design skeleton screens, spinners, progress bars, and empty states. Maintain user confidence during waits.

**error-handling-recovery** — Design error states and recovery workflows. Guide users to resolution with context-aware messages.

**performance-optimization** — Master perceived latency through optimistic UI, skeleton screens, and latency strategies. Make everything feel fast.

### Quality Layer (2 skills)

**accessibility-excellence** — Ensure WCAG compliance, semantic HTML, and inclusive design. Make your product accessible to everyone.

**design-engineer-mindset** — Bridge design and implementation. Understand code as design material and ensure fidelity through development.

## Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your Path

Use the **frontend-orchestrator** skill to assess your current state and choose your implementation path:

- **Path A** — Building from Scratch (MVP → Refined Experience)
- **Path B** — Formalizing Existing Design (Inconsistent → System-Driven)
- **Path C** — Improving Mature System (System-Driven → Transcendent)
- **Path D** — Fixing Performance Issues (Slow → Responsive)
- **Path E** — Improving Accessibility (Partial → Excellent)

### 2. Follow the Sequence

Work through skills in the recommended order. Each skill builds on previous ones.

### 3. Implement with Claude Code

Use Claude Code to implement each skill. Each skill includes:
- Core methodology and frameworks
- Practical examples and templates
- Integration points with other skills
- How to use with Claude Code

## Philosophy

These skills embody the principle of **"uncommon care"** from Interface Craft:

> "Design with uncommon care. Reduce until it's clear. Refine until it's right. Create products that are loved. Interfaces that feel timeless. Experiences that welcome you in and anticipate your needs. Software that feels right."

This is not about trends or speed. This is about craft. This is about respect for the user. This is about creating something that endures.

## How to Use These Skills

### Installation

1. Download all skill files
2. In Claude, go to Settings > Capabilities > Skills
3. Upload each SKILL.md file or create a ZIP with all skills
4. Enable all 13 skills

### With Claude Code

Ask Claude to help you implement each skill:

```
"I'm using the [skill-name] skill. Can you help me:
- [Specific task related to the skill]
- [Implementation details]
- [Integration with other skills]"
```

### Example Workflow

```
"I'm using the frontend-orchestrator skill. My app is an MVP with no design system.
Can you:
- Assess my design maturity
- Recommend a skill sequence
- Create a 12-week implementation plan"
```

Then for each skill:

```
"I'm using the design-foundation skill. Can you help me:
- Define design tokens for spacing, color, typography
- Create a design system structure
- Set up CSS variables"
```

## Integration Between Skills

Skills are designed to work together:

- **design-foundation** provides tokens used by all other skills
- **design-engineer-mindset** ensures fidelity across all implementations
- **visual-hierarchy-refactoring** ties together layout, typography, and color
- **interaction-physics** works with loading-states and error-handling for complete interactions
- **accessibility-excellence** validates all other skills

## Key Principles

**1. Start Where You Are**
Don't try to implement all skills at once. Start with the highest-impact skill for your situation.

**2. Build Momentum**
Early wins create confidence and buy-in for continued improvement.

**3. Iterate, Don't Perfectionism**
Each skill can be refined later. Get the basics right first.

**4. Measure Progress**
Track improvements in user satisfaction, support tickets, and retention.

**5. Celebrate Refinement**
The journey from MVP to transcendent design is a marathon, not a sprint.
