# Positioning Angles Skill

## Overview

Positioning is not about being better. It's about being different in a way that matters to your audience. One angle will outperform others 3-10x. Test, don't guess.

**Keywords**: positioning, differentiation, market positioning, unique value proposition, competitive advantage, messaging strategy, brand positioning

## The 4-Step Positioning Process

### Step 1: Match Your Market Stage

Your positioning approach must match where your market is. Using the wrong approach wastes your message.

| Stage | Market Reality | Your Approach | Template |
|-------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **NEW** | Market doesn't know the solution exists | Simple promise | "Now you can [X]" |
| **GROWING** | Market knows solutions exist, wants results | Bigger claim | "[X] in [specific time]" |
| **CROWDED** | Many competitors, market is confused | Show mechanism | "The [method] that works" |
| **JADED** | Market has been burned, skeptical | Prove it | "[Data/proof] that shows" |
| **MATURE** | Market knows all options, seeks identity | Sell identity | "For [people who are X]" |

**How to identify your stage:**
- **NEW**: You have to explain what the category is
- **GROWING**: Competitors exist but aren't saturating ads/content
- **CROWDED**: Multiple well-known players, active advertising
- **JADED**: Common complaints about the category ("all [X] are scams")
- **MATURE**: Market has clear leaders, buyers identify with brands

### Step 2: Find Your Mechanism

Your mechanism is what you do that competitors skip. It's the "how" behind your results.

**The key question**: What do you do differently that actually creates results?

**Naming your mechanism**:
- Give it a name: "The [X] Method" or "The [X] System"
- NOT "our approach" or "our process" — those are generic
- The name should hint at what makes it work

**Examples**:
- Generic: "Our coaching methodology"
- Named: "The 5-4-3-2-1 Accountability System"
- Generic: "Our hiring process"
- Named: "The Reverse Interview Method"

**Finding your mechanism**:
1. List every step in your process
2. Circle what competitors skip or do differently
3. That's your mechanism — name it

### Step 3: Pick Your Angle

Choose ONE primary angle. Each has a specific psychological trigger.

#### CONTRARIAN
Challenge what everyone believes. Works when conventional wisdom is failing people.

**Template**: "Everything you know about [X] is wrong"

**Examples**:
- "Everything you know about dieting is wrong"
- "Forget everything you learned about cold email"
- "The productivity advice that's actually hurting you"

**Best for**: Markets where common approaches aren't working

---

#### TRANSFORMATION
Show the journey from pain to gain. Works when the emotional gap is large.

**Template**: "From [painful state] to [desired state]"

**Examples**:
- "From broke freelancer to $20K/month agency owner"
- "From inbox chaos to zero unread in 30 days"
- "From dreading Mondays to building your dream business"

**Best for**: Offers with clear before/after states

---

#### ENEMY
Give them something to fight against. Works when there's a clear villain.

**Template**: "Stop letting [X] steal your [Y]"

**Examples**:
- "Stop letting algorithms steal your reach"
- "Stop letting meetings steal your deep work"
- "Stop letting big agencies steal your budget"

**Best for**: Markets with frustration toward a specific problem/entity

---

#### SPEED
Promise results fast without the usual sacrifice. Works when people are impatient.

**Template**: "[Outcome] in [time] without [sacrifice]"

**Examples**:
- "6-pack abs in 90 days without giving up carbs"
- "Launch your course in 2 weeks without tech headaches"
- "Fluent Spanish in 3 months without grammar drills"

**Best for**: Offers that genuinely deliver faster results

---

#### SPECIFICITY
Narrow down to exact person and exact outcome. Works in crowded markets.

**Template**: "For [exact person] who wants [exact thing]"

**Examples**:
- "For SaaS founders who want to hit $10K MRR"
- "For busy moms who want to lose 20 lbs before summer"
- "For developers who want to become tech leads in 2024"

**Best for**: Crowded markets where you can own a niche

### Step 4: Test Your Angle

Before committing, run your positioning through this checklist:

| Test | Question | Bad Example | Good Example |
|------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Specific?** | Does it include concrete details? | "Get better results" | "Lose 20 lbs in 6 weeks" |
| **Differentiated?** | Can a competitor claim the same thing? | "Quality marketing services" | "The Reverse Funnel Method for coaches" |
| **Believable?** | Does your mechanism/proof support it? | "Become a millionaire overnight" | "Add $5K/month with 3 LinkedIn posts per week" |

**All three boxes must be checked.** If any fails:
- Not specific → Add numbers, timeframes, or details
- Not differentiated → Lean harder into your mechanism
- Not believable → Reduce the claim or add proof

## Putting It Together

**Formula**: [Market Stage Approach] + [Your Mechanism] + [Your Angle]

**Example walkthrough**:
1. **Market Stage**: Crowded (many course platforms exist) → Show mechanism
2. **Mechanism**: "The Micro-Launch Method" (launching with just 10 people)
3. **Angle**: Speed → "Launch your course in 2 weeks without building an audience first"

**Final positioning**: "The Micro-Launch Method: Launch your course in 2 weeks without building an audience first"
