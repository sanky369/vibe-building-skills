Each email in a sequence should stand alone AND work together as a journey.

## Email Components

### Subject Line

Your subject line determines if they open.

**Formulas**:
- Curiosity: "The one thing [type] gets wrong about [topic]"
- Specificity: "How I [result] in [timeframe]"
- Benefit: "[Benefit] without [drawback]"
- Question: "Are you [situation]?"
- Urgency: "[Deadline] to [action]"

### Preview Text

The first 40-50 characters of your email. Make it count.

### Opening

Start with their name and something personal.

**Formula**: "[Name] + [Personal observation]"

### Hook

First few sentences must make them want to keep reading.

**Types**:
- Story: "Last Tuesday, I was..."
- Question: "Are you struggling with...?"
- Curiosity: "I discovered something this week..."

### Body

Provide value or make your case.

**For Value**: Share a lesson, story, framework, or answer

**For Sales**: Explain problem, show your solution, address objections

### Call-to-Action

End with a clear, specific action.

**Formulas**:
- Simple: "Click here to [action]"
- Benefit: "Get [benefit] now"
- Curiosity: "See how this works"
- Low-friction: "Reply and let me know"

### Signature

End with your name and a personal touch.

**Formula**: "[Name] + [P.S. with relevant insight]"
