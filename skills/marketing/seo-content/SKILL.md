# SEO Content Skill

**Related**: See `./seo-strategy` for the complete strategic framework and keyword research methodology.

## The Modern SEO Content Framework

### Two Layers of Optimization

1. **For Search Engines** — Technical optimization for ranking
2. **For People** — Engaging, valuable content that converts

The best SEO content serves both equally.

### The E-E-A-T Imperative

Google now evaluates all content against E-E-A-T:

| Factor | How to Demonstrate |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Experience** | First-hand examples, real case studies, personal insights |
| **Expertise** | Deep knowledge, accurate information, comprehensive coverage |
| **Authoritativeness** | Credentials, citations, external recognition |
| **Trustworthiness** | Accuracy, sources, transparency, no misleading claims |

**Action**: Every article should include at least one personal example, cite 2-3 authoritative sources, and demonstrate depth beyond surface-level coverage.

---

## Layer 1: Search Engine Optimization

### Keyword Optimization

**Primary Keyword**: Your main target keyword

**Placement Strategy**:
| Location | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Title tag | First 60 characters |
| H1 heading | Include naturally |
| First 100 words | Early placement |
| Body content | 2-3 times naturally |
| Subheadings | Where relevant |
| URL slug | Short, keyword-included |

**Secondary Keywords**: Related terms that support the primary keyword
- Use naturally throughout content
- Include in H2/H3 headings where relevant
- Support topical completeness

### Title Tag Formula

**Requirements**: 50-60 characters, keyword early, compelling

**Formulas**:
```
[Keyword]: [Number] [Benefit/Strategies/Ways] for [Outcome]
How to [Keyword] in [Year]: [Specific Benefit]
[Keyword]: The Complete Guide to [Outcome]
[Number] [Keyword] Tips That [Specific Result]
```

**Examples**:
- "Remote Team Management: 7 Strategies That Actually Work"
- "How to Improve Core Web Vitals in 2025: Complete Guide"

### Meta Description

**Requirements**: 150-160 characters, keyword included, compelling CTA

**Formula**: "[Benefit statement]. Learn [specific outcome] with [unique angle]. [Soft CTA]."

**Example**: "Master remote team management with 7 proven strategies. Learn how top companies boost productivity by 40%. Complete guide inside."

### Heading Structure

Use proper hierarchy to signal content structure:

```
H1: [Main Topic with Primary Keyword]
  H2: [Major Section 1]
    H3: [Subsection]
    H3: [Subsection]
  H2: [Major Section 2]
    H3: [Subsection]
  H2: FAQ (for featured snippets)
```

**Rules**:
- One H1 per page
- H2s for main sections (5-8 for comprehensive articles)
- H3s for subsections within H2s
- Include keywords naturally in headings

### Content Length Guidelines

| Keyword Competition | Target Length |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Low competition | 1,500-2,000 words |
| Medium competition | 2,000-3,000 words |
| High competition | 3,000-5,000+ words |

**Key insight**: Longer content ranks better IF it's comprehensive and valuable. Padding for length hurts rankings.

---

## Layer 2: Human Optimization

### Content Structure Template

**1. Opening Hook (First 2-3 sentences)**
- Answer search intent immediately
- Create curiosity or promise value
- Make them want to continue

**Example**:
> "Most remote teams fail because of one fixable problem: unclear communication protocols. In this guide, you'll learn the exact 7 strategies that helped 500+ companies boost remote productivity by 40%."

**2. Table of Contents**
- For articles 1,500+ words
- Improves navigation
- Helps search engines understand structure
- Enables jump links in search results

**3. Main Content Sections**
Each section should:
- Address one specific subtopic
- Include practical examples
- Provide actionable takeaways
- Use formatting for scannability

**4. FAQ Section**
- Target featured snippets
- Answer related questions
- Use exact question format
- Keep answers concise (40-60 words)

**5. Conclusion**
- Summarize key takeaways (3-5 bullets)
- Include clear call-to-action
- Link to related content
- Reinforce main value proposition

### Search Intent Alignment

**Critical**: Match your content format to searcher intent.

| Intent Type | What They Want | Content Format |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Informational | "How to manage remote teams" | Comprehensive tutorial/guide |
| Commercial | "Best remote team tools" | Comparison, reviews, rankings |
| Transactional | "Asana pricing" | Pricing page, product page |
| Navigational | "Slack login" | Direct page, comparison to alternatives |

**Wrong format = no ranking**, regardless of content quality.

### Readability Standards

- **Paragraphs**: 2-3 sentences max
- **Sentences**: Under 20 words preferred
- **Subheadings**: Every 200-300 words
- **Bullet points**: For lists of 3+ items
- **Bold text**: Key phrases and takeaways
- **White space**: Generous margins and padding

### Engagement Elements

Include these to increase dwell time and reduce bounce:

| Element | Purpose | Frequency |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Real examples | Demonstrate expertise | Every major section |
| Data/statistics | Build credibility | 3-5 per article |
| Images/visuals | Break up text, illustrate points | Every 300-500 words |
| Actionable tips | Provide immediate value | Throughout |
| Case studies | Show proof of concepts | 1-2 per article |
| Pull quotes | Highlight key insights | 2-3 per article |
