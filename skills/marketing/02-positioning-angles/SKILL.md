# Positioning Angles Skill

## Overview

Positioning Angles are the unique angles that make your offer compelling and different. This skill teaches you 8 frameworks to find your positioning.

**Keywords**: positioning, differentiation, market positioning, unique value proposition, competitive advantage, messaging strategy, brand positioning

## Core Methodology

Positioning is not about being better. It's about being different in a way that matters to your audience.

There are 8 proven positioning frameworks:

1. **Problem Inversion** — Position against the problem, not the solution
2. **Outcome Reframe** — Reframe the outcome in unexpected ways
3. **Audience Specificity** — Position for a specific audience
4. **Mechanism** — Position around your unique mechanism or method
5. **Comparison** — Position against a known alternative
6. **Constraint-Based** — Position around a specific constraint
7. **Transformation** — Position around the transformation you provide
8. **Contrarian** — Position against conventional wisdom

## The 8 Positioning Frameworks

### Framework 1: Problem Inversion

Instead of positioning your solution, position against the problem.

**Formula**: "The [problem] problem. Here's how we solve it."

**Example**: Instead of "Project management software," position as "The project chaos problem. Here's how we bring order."

### Framework 2: Outcome Reframe

Reframe the outcome in an unexpected way.

**Formula**: "Most people think [common outcome]. We deliver [unexpected outcome]."

**Example**: Instead of "Email marketing platform," position as "Most people think email is about opens and clicks. We deliver revenue."

### Framework 3: Audience Specificity

Position for a specific audience, not everyone.

**Formula**: "The [specific audience] solution for [specific problem]."

**Example**: Instead of "CRM for businesses," position as "The CRM for remote sales teams."

### Framework 4: Mechanism

Position around your unique mechanism or method.

**Formula**: "We solve [problem] using [unique mechanism]."

**Example**: Instead of "Fitness app," position as "We use AI coaching to personalize your workouts."

### Framework 5: Comparison

Position against a known alternative.

**Formula**: "[Your offer] for [known alternative]."

**Example**: Instead of "Video editing software," position as "Adobe Premiere for creators, not filmmakers."

### Framework 6: Constraint-Based

Position around a specific constraint.

**Formula**: "The [constraint] solution for [problem]."

**Example**: Instead of "Marketing agency," position as "The marketing agency for bootstrapped founders."

### Framework 7: Transformation

Position around the transformation you provide.

**Formula**: "We transform [current state] into [desired state]."

**Example**: Instead of "Writing course," position as "We transform writers into published authors."

### Framework 8: Contrarian

Position against conventional wisdom.

**Formula**: "Everyone says [conventional wisdom]. We believe [contrarian view]."

**Example**: Instead of "Productivity app," position as "Everyone says you need more tools. We believe you need fewer."

## How to Use This Skill

1. **Choose Your Framework** — Which framework fits your offer?
2. **Generate Angles** — Create 3-5 positioning statements using that framework
3. **Test Your Angles** — Which one resonates most with your audience?
4. **Refine** — Adjust based on feedback
5. **Commit** — Choose one primary positioning angle

**Too Niche** — Your positioning limits your market too much.  
**Unclear** — Your positioning confuses rather than clarifies.
