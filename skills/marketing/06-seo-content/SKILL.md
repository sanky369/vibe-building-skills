# SEO Content Skill

## Overview

SEO Content is content optimized for search engines that also engages and converts readers. This skill teaches you to write content that ranks and resonates.

**Keywords**: SEO content, search engine optimization, content marketing, ranking content, organic traffic, search intent, content strategy

## Core Methodology

SEO Content has two layers:

1. **For Search Engines** — Optimized for ranking
2. **For People** — Engaging and valuable

The best SEO content serves both.

## Layer 1: Optimize for Search Engines

### Keyword Optimization

**Primary Keyword**: The main keyword you're targeting

**Example**: "remote team management"

**Where to use**:
- Title tag (first 60 characters)
- H1 heading (first heading)
- First 100 words
- 2-3 times throughout the article
- In subheadings

**Secondary Keywords**: Related keywords to target

**Example**: "how to manage remote teams," "distributed team communication"

**Where to use**: Naturally throughout the article

### Title Tag

Your title tag appears in search results and should:
- Include your primary keyword
- Be 50-60 characters
- Create curiosity or promise benefit

**Formula**: "[Keyword]: [Benefit or Question]"

**Example**: "Remote Team Management: 7 Strategies for Success"

### Meta Description

Your meta description appears under your title in search results:
- 150-160 characters
- Include your keyword
- Create curiosity or promise value

**Formula**: "[Benefit]. Learn [specific outcome] in this guide."

**Example**: "Learn 7 proven strategies to manage remote teams effectively and boost productivity. Complete guide with actionable tips."

### Heading Structure

Use proper heading hierarchy:
- H1: Your main topic (one per page)
- H2: Main sections
- H3: Subsections

**Example**:
```
H1: Remote Team Management: 7 Strategies for Success
H2: Strategy 1: Clear Communication Protocols
H3: Why Communication Matters
H3: How to Implement
```

### Content Length

Target 2,000-3,000 words for competitive keywords. Longer content ranks better IF it's valuable.
